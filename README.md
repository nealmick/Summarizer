# ChatGPT Summarizer

The project, built using OpenAI's Davinci text model, analyzes input text and summarizes key concepts within a specified character limit. Utilizing the Python programming language and the Django web framework, the project connects the user to the GPT API through a simple prompt, "Summarize this in x characters:" followed by the user's input. The prompt can be easily modified in the future to provide further explanation or simplification of the input text.
'''
prompt = "Summarize this in less then "+str(int(int(length)/7))+" words: "+text
